# reinforcement-learning-material-ws-2018
This repository collects supplementary material to study reinforcement learning with a focus on topics covered by the TU Darmstadt IAS lecture on reinforcement learning.

The repository is structured by topics and is basically a collection of ressources which explain or highlight different algorithms and theories covered in the lecture. All material should be categorized into four different tiers: introductory light reading (i.e. medium posts, non-scientific tutorials), research papers (preferably with arxiv links), textbooks (only if they are available via ULB Darmstad) and code examples.

## Materials by topic

### Foundations of MDP and reinforcement learning


### Policy and value iteration


### LQR and classical control


### Temporal difference learning and function approximation


### POMDP and filtering


### Policy Gradient methods


## Contribution guidelines

Please feel free to add your own suggestions for interesting material with a short summary on how they are helpful. Just open a pull request to the repository and add all your suggested material to the readme file. Please don't add any papers to the repo, just the relevant links to prevent breaking any copyright issues or cluttering the repository.
